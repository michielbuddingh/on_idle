Short term:a
      * Daemonize
      * Comments, documentation
      * Bugtesting
      * Some if statements could be eliminated if the delay for
      	task[N+1] can be set to infinity.

Long term:
     * rewrite to daemon + client app that allows users to add
       	       new commands to the queue at runtime.
